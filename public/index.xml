      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Catalin, a software engineer located in the Netherlands. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m consulting on cloud native technologies and bootstrapping a product around cloud computing cost: Oktamize. I&amp;rsquo;m also the organizer of the Randstad Docker meetup and one of the organizers of Serverless Days Amsterdam conference
I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about my journey into bootstrapping a company (second attempt), tech events, tech how-to&amp;rsquo;s (Docker, Kubernetes, etc) and books worth reading.
You can reach out by twitter (DM&amp;rsquo;s are open) or email: catalin [@] oktamize.</description>

      <description>In preparation for the Serverlesdays Amsterdam conference, I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a Docker meetup around Functions as a Service (#FaaS) build on top of containers. How are they build, why and what can you do with them. We managed to get some core people from 2 projects/communities that build open-source serverless platforms: fnproject and OpenFaas. We were hosted by Oracle Netherlands in their Utrecht HQ and I was glad to see a lot of first timers at the meetup.</description>
