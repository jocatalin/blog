[Docker Netherlands User Group] (https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Randstad/) is one of the biggest european Docker comunities with more than 3000 members. We're running the meetups around the Randstad region (mainly Amsterdam & Utrecht) and we focus on developer oriented talks and free workshops. We're always looking for speakers, hosts/sponsors or volunteers to help us expand. Get in touch if you can or wanna help!
