Hi there, I'm Catalin, a software engineer located in the Netherlands. I'm currently consulting around [cloud native technologies](https://cncf.io) and trying to boostrap on the side a company/product around cloud cost optimizations [Oktamize] (https://oktamzie.com). 
I'm also the organizer of the [dutch Docker meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Randstad/) and one of the organizes of [Serverless Days Amsterdam conference](https://serverlessdays.amsterdam)

I'll blog about my journey into bootstarping a company (it's my second attempt), tech events, tech how-to's (Docker, Kubernetes, etc) and books that I consider worth reading.
